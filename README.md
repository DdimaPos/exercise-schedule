# exercise-schedule
It's a to-do list with categories wich I created it to write down exercises for my workout routine. 
For example you can create category named ''monday'' or ''office'' and write there the tasks you have to do:"cook soup","change keyboard" and others. 

You can delete and edit categories and tasks. Also tasks can be checked. 

All information that you put there(also if a task is checked or not) is saved in local storage. 
If you know how to use developer tools you can check the structure of the objects in local storage. 
It was the first time I worked with that kind of structures.

I hope my project will be helpful for you:)
